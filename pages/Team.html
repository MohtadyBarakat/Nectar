                            <p>With an environment that is rapidly becoming more affected by the toxic waste we create, Azza Faiad set out to find a solution for this worldwide expanding problem. At the age of only 16, she came up with an idea to convert plastic waste into hydrocarbon fuel by using a low-cost catalyst. Her idea was awarded the EFDA-JET prize at the 23rd European Union Contest for Young Scientists. A successive win was achieved in Turkey when she and a teammate won a gold medal during the 21st International Environmental project Olympiad for their research on the same topic. At such a young age she admits that the atmosphere of competition and representing Egypt in international competitions were her biggest life lessons so far.</p>
